	/* INSTRUCTIONS: 
	 *
	 * Your work lies at the bottom of this file. 
	 * 
	 * Using express routes in tandem with hasOne's and hasMany's accessor methods, 
	 * you will grab brad's uniform and his employees and serve them to the client as raw json.
	 * 
	 * How do you do that?
	 * 1) consult the documentation here
	 *		a. hasOne: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/api/associations/has-one/
	 * 		b. hasMany: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/api/associations/has-many/
	 *
	 *
	 * 2) If you figure out what methods you need and how they work, help any neighbors who do not
	 *		have the solution. Offer assistance to at least three of your neighbors.
	 *		If you solve the problem but your two nearest neighbors haven't, 
	 *		then your assignment is not complete.
	 *
	 *
	 * 3) If you find yourself stuck, then ask for assistance 
	 *		from either your instructor, a TA or a fellow student. 
	 *
	 *
	 * Note: The point of this exercise is not only to teach how getAssociation(s) work,
	 * but to train you to analyze a high-level problem and find real solutions
	 * with documentation and communication.
	 *
	 * Good luck!
